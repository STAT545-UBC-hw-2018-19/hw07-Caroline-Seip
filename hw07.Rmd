The goal of this assignment is to contine developing the `powers` package by:

- Defining and exporting one new function
- Giving the function arguments sensible defaults
- Documenting all exported functions
- Including at least three unti tests for the new function 
- `check` that the function works without errors
- Update the README and vignette to show usage of all the functions in the package
- Modify the instructions to tell someone how to install the package
